# IncidentsDataAnalysis
There is a project on incidents data analyse from zufers (Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics) and our boss is Christoph Schubert.

We want to build a system that for security managers or officials so that they can know the security status of some districts clearly and make some decisions to maintain the safety and stability in these areas.
